*** serving the Tor Browser Bundle via Google Documents API and XMPP IM Robot(Jabber)
***

OVERVIEW
--------
GoogBot is a program for serving Tor Browser bundle and manual files over XMPP and Google Docs API. Users interact
with GoogBot by sending it XMPP (Jabber) IM requests.

The following document explains how to setup GoogBot for a server admin.

PREREQUISITES
-------------

To deploy GoogBot we rely on the following applications:
- Python 2.7.1+ - Tested on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS running Python 2.7.1+
- p7zip-full - apt-get install p7zip-full
- git-core - apt-get install git-core
- http://gdata-python-client.googlecode.com/files/gdata-2.0.15.tar.gz (invluded with application)
- The PHP XMPP Library (included with application)
- crontab - for rsync jobs
- php5-cli - apt-get install php5-cli


SETUP
-----
1. Install the prerequisites mentioned above
2. clone the git repository to a desired location on your server, for example: /opt/GoogBot
3. we use a rsync command and run it with a cronjob to maintain a fresh copy 
of all tor-browser bundles and to create zip files containing a short-manual and the requested 
tor-browser bundle with signatue file then upload the zip files to Google Docs.
All the steps in #3 are implemented: sync-all.py which we need to run everytime there as a new Tor Browser Bundle release.
# Note: This file removes all the previously uploaded files and therefore any user with an old file in their Google Docs, would loose access aswell.
It's actually a pretty nice feature, so we basically force the user to request a new package. We should make this more clear in the Documentation and manuals.
    rsync://rsync.torproject.org/tor/dist/tor-browser
    rsync://rsync.torproject.org/tor/dist/manual
4. Finally rename the config files and enter your email and passwords:
config-gmail-user.php.sample => config-gmail-user.php
config.py.sample => config.py
5. and run the server this way: ./googbot-server.php the bot acts like a daemon and runs in the background.
The only way to stop it, is to kill the php ptocess.
