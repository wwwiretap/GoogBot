SETUP
-----
1. Install the prerequisites mentioned above
2. clone the git repository to a desired location on your server, for example: /opt/GoogBot
3. we use a rsync command and run it with a cronjob to maintain a fresh copy 
of all tor-browser bundles and to create zip files containing a short-manual and the requested 
tor-browser bundle with signatue file then upload the zip files to Google Docs.
All the steps in #3 are implemented: sync-all.py which we need to run as a cron-job"
